**youtube-client** is a lightweight native GNOME desktop application that embeds a **WebKit2** web view, designed as a clean, dedicated wrapper for **Youtube**.

Instead of opening Youtube in a full web browser, you get a focused, native Linux window with persistent login, quick bookmarks, URL bar, and a simple interface.

This project is built using [CIAO](https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao) (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered).

---

## Features

- Embedded WebKit2GTK browser engine
- Persistent cookie storage (`~/.app/youtube-client/cookies/`) — stay logged in across sessions
- Smart URL bar with automatic updating
- Quick bookmarks for Youtube and common pages
- Clean menu bar (File → Bookmark / Exit, About → Show Version)
- Lightweight and fast (much lighter than Electron-based apps)
- Flexible build system supporting **Simple GCC**, **GNU Make (autotools)**, **Gradle**, **Ant**, and **Meson + Ninja**
- Fully compatible with **SyncPrjs** project synchronization tool

## Project Background & Credits

- **Author**: Cloudgen Wong ([@cloudgen](https://github.com/cloudgen)) – Hong Kong
- **CIAO Principles**: This project is built using **CIAO (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered)** — a defensive programming methodology founded by Cloudgen Wong.  
  [CIAO](https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao) emphasizes writing robust, thoughtful, and deliberately over-engineered code that resists breakage and handles edge cases gracefully.  
  See **[CIAO-PRINCIPLES.md](CIAO-PRINCIPLES.md)** and the official CIAO repository: [https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao](https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao)
- **Original Reference**: Heavily inspired and modified from the `pix-client` project by **Wilgat** ([https://github.com/Wilgat/pix-client](https://github.com/Wilgat/pix-client)).
- **SyncPrjs Compatibility**: Fully compatible with **SyncPrjs** by Wilgat ([https://github.com/Wilgat/SyncPrjs](https://github.com/Wilgat/SyncPrjs)).

Many core ideas (modular C structure, cookie persistence, multi-build-system support, and GTK + WebKit2 architecture) come from Wilgat’s family of “*-client” wrappers.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies (Ubuntu / Debian)

```bash
./build.sh install
```

**For Meson** (recommended modern method), also install Meson + Ninja:

```bash
sudo apt install meson ninja-build
```

### 2. Build the application

**Recommended (fastest & simplest):**

```bash
./build.sh clean && ./build.sh build
```

**Alternative build methods:**

```bash
# Meson + Ninja (modern, clean, recommended for GTK apps)
./build.sh meson

# GNU Make / Autotools
./build.sh make

# Gradle
./gradlew clean build

# Ant (legacy)
./build.sh ant
```

The executable will be placed at:

```
target/exe/debug/youtube-client
```

### 3. Run the application

```bash
./target/exe/debug/youtube-client
```

---

## Usage

- Enter or paste a URL in the address bar and press **Go**
- Use **File → Bookmark** for quick access to Youtube pages
- **About → Show Version** displays build and version information
- All cookies and login sessions are automatically persisted

---

## Build Methods

Detailed instructions for all **five** build systems are available in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder:

- **[docs/build-methods.md](docs/build-methods.md)** — Overview of all build methods
- **[docs/basic-steps.md](docs/basic-steps.md)** — Simple GCC build (recommended for quick testing)
- **[docs/gnu-make-steps.md](docs/gnu-make-steps.md)** — GNU Make / Autotools
- **[docs/gradle-steps.md](docs/gradle-steps.md)** — Gradle build
- **[docs/ant-steps.md](docs/ant-steps.md)** — Ant build (legacy)
- **[docs/meson-steps.md](docs/meson-steps.md)** — **Meson + Ninja** (new modern method)
